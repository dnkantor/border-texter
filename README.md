General Description:

Welcome to the border texter app. This app allows you to text a US/CANADA border crossing bridge name such as "Peace Bridge" to a number created on Twilio, the program will text you back the delay of that bridge. This is useful when trying to quickly figure out which bridge is the best to take based on delay times.
